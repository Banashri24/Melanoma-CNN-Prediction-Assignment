## General Information

  ## Project Information
  To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
  ## Project Background
  In this assignment, we will build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 

  ##Problem Statement
  The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.The data set contains the following diseases:

	Actinic keratosis
	Basal cell carcinoma
	Dermatofibroma
	Melanoma
	Nevus
	Pigmented benign keratosis
	Seborrheic keratosis
	Squamous cell carcinoma
	Vascular lesion
  
   ##Dataset
   Defined the path for both train and test images from dataset.

## Conclusions
Created a CNN model, which can accurately detect 9 classes present in the dataset.
Defined appropriate optimiser and loss function for model training.
Trained the model for ~20 epochs.
Explained the findings after the model fit with evidence if the issues are resolved or not.
